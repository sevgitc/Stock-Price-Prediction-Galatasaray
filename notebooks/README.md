# ðŸ“’ Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook files and their HTML exports used throughout the project.

## Files

- `1_data_scraping.ipynb` / `.html`: Python code for scraping historical stock price and match result data
- `2_modeling.ipynb` / `.html`: Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development (ARIMA, LSTM, Ridge, etc.)

Both `.ipynb` and `.html` versions are included for flexibility:
- Use `.ipynb` to run and interact with the code
- Use `.html` to view outputs without needing a Jupyter environment
